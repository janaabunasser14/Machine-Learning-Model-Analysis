# Machine-Learning-Model-Analysis


This project investigates different machine learning models for predictive tasks. It starts with selecting a dataset and evaluating a baseline model using nearest neighbor algorithms. Two additional models are then tested, followed by an analysis of the best-performing model's performance, including insights into prediction errors.
